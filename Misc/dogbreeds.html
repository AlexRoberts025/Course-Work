        <p>The Pit Bull has a stocky, muscular build and a short, smooth coat varying in color. The body of the Pit Bull is long, with a short, whip-like tail that ends in a point.

With their impressive stamina and staunch work ethic, they enjoy a variety of sports. Especially when adolescent, these dogs have a tendency to get easily excited, so adequate exercise, training, and mental stimulation are a must for these dogs.
        While most experts agree that Pit Bulls are a short-coated dog characterized by a wide skull, powerful jaws and a muscular, stocky body, there is great variation in appearance. Typically 35 to 65 pounds, some weigh as little as 25 pounds, others tip the scales at 80 pounds or more.</p>
